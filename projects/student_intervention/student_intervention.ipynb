In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

This could be approached as a regression problem, where each student would be given a score (maybe from one to 100) to quantify their risk of failing to graduate. However, since the outcome of interest is binary (intervention or not) and a regression score would only be used to determine a binary outcome, a classification approach makes more sense."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "## Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Industry appliction: \n",
    "A study published in PNAS this year described the use of SVMs to predict the pathologic potential of different strains of E. coli isolated from cows using genomic data. /n\n",
    "### Strengths: \n",
    "SVMs, when combined with the kernel trick, are great at modeling data that is not linearly separable. The kernel trick provides a wide range of functions to model complex relationships. /n\n",
    "### Weaknesses: \n",
    "The use of the kernel trick to separate non-linear data can make it difficult to interpret the inner workings of the algorithm. In other words, SVMs can be somewhat of a black box, whereas other algorithms, like decision trees, are easier to interpret and to follow the reasoning behind a given classification. SVM could also be overkill if the underlying function turns out to have relatively low dimensionality. Training time can be much longer with SVMs if using non-linear kernels.\n",
    "### Why SVM?: \n",
    "SVM would work well in this case because they offer more flexibility via kernels, and we don't have to worry about long training times because the data set is relatively small. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "### Industry application:\n",
    "A recent paper described the use of decision trees to classify websites as 'malicious' or not.\n",
    "### Strengths:\n",
    "Decision trees implicitly perform feature selection, can capture non-linear relationships, require little data scrubbing, and they are easy to interpret, diagram, and explain. \n",
    "### Weaknesses:\n",
    "They often overfit and they aren't 'smooth' (i.e. they don't draw smooth borders between data points, like SVM + kernels do).\n",
    "### Why decision trees?:\n",
    "This is likely a relatively simple problem that could be captured well by decision trees, and the result will be easy to interpret. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Industry application:\n",
    "A recent paper in the journal of Clinical Neuroscience described the use of naive bayes to identify evidence of stroke on MRI scans.\n",
    "### Strengths:\n",
    "Simple. NB is great at accounting for 'blurry' lines in the data (i.e. data that is not easily separable linearly or non-linearly). \n",
    "### Weaknesses:\n",
    "Can't learn interactions between features.\n",
    "### Why NB?:\n",
    "NB would be a simple and easy solution to the problem that could be easily implemented with a short run time.\n",

    "SVM performed the best. Even with relatively few data points (100) SVM outperformed the other two algorithms when using all of the available training data (300). SVM  took the longest to train and to predict (by an order of magnitude), but the actual run time difference is negligible. If this was intended for real-time prediction, run time could play a factor but in this scenario run time differences of this magnitude are completely irrelevent. \n",

SVM would approach this problem by looking at each part of the sky and drawing a line to divide blue from white. You can imagine this process happening in two dimensions or three dimensions. For a problem as complex as this one, we use dozens of dimensions but the problem is still the same. We are trying to separate students who will pass vs. those that won't, and SVM helps us find the borders between them."
